# Shader MoirÃ© Lines ðŸŒŠâœ¨

Did you ever stare at wavy patterns moving across a screen and wonderâ€”how is that even possible?  
**This project brings the mesmerizing moirÃ© effect to life using TouchDesigner and animated shader lines!**

Inspired by [this Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFclaRKTW63/), this experiment explores interactive, real-time generative art driven by classic moirÃ© interference. It's visually trippy, hypnotic, and a fantastic introduction to both shaders and motion graphics.

## âœ¨ What is it?

- **Real-time shader animation** creating intersecting, animated lines
- Interactive and endlessly customizable moirÃ© patterns as you tweak parameters
- No actual "drawing"â€”just smart use of GLSL (or TouchDesigner's nodes) and math for art
- Perfect for backgrounds, VJ sets, or creative coding playgrounds

---

## ðŸ›  How does it work?

1. **Shader Magic**:  
   - Render layered or intersecting lines using simple mathematical functions in a GLSL TOP (or built-in nodes)
2. **Animate!**:  
   - Animate lines by shifting frequency, amplitude, or offset variables over time
3. **MoirÃ© Patterns**:  
   - Overlay two or more waves/grids, controlling angles and speedsâ€”watch interference magic appear!
4. **Interactivity**:  
   - Add controls for speed, direction, or color to make the visuals dance to your taste

## ðŸŽ¯ Why you'll love this

- **Instant ambient visuals**â€”perfect as a screensaver or for live projection art
- Learn core shader logic or generative art principles, but play it all in real-time
- Meditative, hypnotic, and surprisingly minimal code
- *Great entry point* for TouchDesigner users who want to try shaders or sound-reactive graphics
