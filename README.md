# TouchDesigner Projects ✨

Welcome to my collection of playful, experimental, and generative visual projects—all built with TouchDesigner by Derivative!

## 🌟 What is TouchDesigner?

TouchDesigner is a powerful node-based platform for **real-time interactive multimedia**, developed by the brilliant team at Derivative. It's a creative playground where you design visuals, sound, and interaction using nodes, shaders, and live inputs. Ideal for art installations, live events, generative design, VJing, prototyping—really, anything you imagine.

## 💡 Uses & Possibilities

- Generative art, creative coding, and electronic visuals
- Audio-visual installations and live performance
- Interactive, sensor-driven media
- Motion graphics, particle experiments, and shader playgrounds
- Rapid prototyping for multimedia projects

## 🧩 About This Repo

Each subfolder here is a mini-experiment or project, inspired by creative code, Instagram reels, and digital art trends. Every experiment is open source and ready for remix, critique, or simply wonder!
