# Colorful Flow

A TouchDesigner experiment creating vibrant, flowing patterns using fluid simulation and color mixing techniques.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [this Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNEN26wRUC6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) showcasing fluid color dynamics.

## Visual Effect

- Fluid-like motion with smooth color transitions
- Multiple color streams that blend and interact
- Organic flow patterns that evolve over time
- High saturation colors create vibrant compositions
- Trails and smearing effects enhance fluidity

## Interaction

- Mouse/touch creates color injection points
- Movement speed affects flow velocity
- Audio input influences color choices and flow patterns
- Interactive manipulation of flow direction and intensity

## Creative Coding Focus

- **Feedback Systems**: Creating fluid motion through feedback loops
- **Color Blending**: Advanced composite operations
- **Optical Flow**: Motion-based visual effects
- **Particle Advection**: Particles following flow fields
- **Blur and Smear**: Post-processing for smooth trails

## Technical Approach

- Feedback TOPs for accumulation effects
- Composite TOPs with various blend modes
- Level and Blur TOPs for smoothing
- CHOP-driven color parameter control
- Optical Flow analysis for motion enhancement
