# Webcam Particles ðŸŽ‰âœ¨

Ever wished your webcam could do something a littleâ€¦ magical?  
**This project unleashes particle magic straight from your video feed!**

Inspired by [this Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP87WHziMiI/), this TouchDesigner experiment lets pure white spots from your webcam *emit* dynamic particles in real-time. It's playful, mesmerizing, and the perfect way to get creative with new media artâ€”even if you're just starting out.

## âœ¨ What is it?

- **Live webcam feed** processed in TouchDesigner
- **Bright (white) regions** become emitters for vibrant, animated particles
- All **no-code** TouchDesignerâ€”just connect, tweak, and get instant interactive results
- Beginner-friendly, but open to deep customizations for tinkerers

## ðŸ›  How does it work?

1. **Webcam Input**: Streams your camera using Video Device In TOP
2. **Brightness Masking**: Detects the brightest (white) zones with a Threshold/Luma node
3. **Particle Emission**: Spawns whimsical particles right where brightness hits the screen
4. **Style Your Magic**: Adjust color, speed, glow, and trails to your heart's content
